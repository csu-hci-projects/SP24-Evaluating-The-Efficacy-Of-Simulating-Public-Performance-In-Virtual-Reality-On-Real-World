## How To Run The Project
In order to run the project, you will need Unity version 2021.3.6f1. If you do not have this, the Oculus may not work with the following set up.
Once this version is downloaded, download our source code, which should have all the correct project settings. Once the project is opened the 
Oculus will have to be connected via cable to the machine you are running it on. Make sure quest link is activated. Once quest link is enabled 
(it should prompt you inside the headset), you should see the desktop view in the Oculus and it should be ready to go. In Unity, make sure the 
Performance Environment scene is activated. If it's not, in the project file manager window there will be an assets folder, which has 
Performance Environment.unity. Once this scene is active, all you should have to do is press the play button and the environment will show in the 
Oculus headset. 

### Debugging Unity:
If running the correct Unity scene does not work, the settings within Unity may be wrong. Go to Edit >> Project Settings. Once the project 
settings window is open, scroll down on the left side to XR Plug-in Management. Once you click on it, install it if you haven't already. 
Once it's installed select the OpenXR checkbox under the Windows, Max, and Linux settings (the icon looks like a computer monitor). 
Then, select the XR Plug-in Management dropdown on the left side and select the OpenXR section. In the Interaction Profiles section, select 
the plus button at the bottom right and add the Oculus Touch Controller Profile. 

### Debugging Oculus:
If the steps above did not work the problem may be within the Oculus settings. Open the Meta Quest Link app. Make sure the Oculus is connected. 
Then, go to the settings tab on the left side. Once you click on it, there should be a header towards the top of the screen that says Beta. Click
on that. Make sure the Developer Runtime Features switch is on and blue (Or whatever color signifies it's activated). If the Quest Link Enable did 
not prompt you, go to the quick settings button on the control bar. Once you click on that, click the Quest Link tab. Inside that, click launch and 
you should be in the proper view.
