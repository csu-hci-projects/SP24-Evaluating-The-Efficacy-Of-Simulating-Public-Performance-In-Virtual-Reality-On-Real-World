## How To Run The Project
In order to run the project, you will need Unity version 2021.3.6f1. If you do not have this, the Oculus may not work with the following set up.
Once this version is downloaded, download our source code, which should have all the correct project settings. Once the project is opened the 
Oculus will have to be connected via cable to the machine you are running it on. Make sure quest link is activated and the oculus is in debug 
mode. Once quest link is launched and you see the desktop view in the Oculus, it should be ready to go. In Unity, make sure the Performance 
Environment scene is activated. If it's not, in the file manager there will be an assets folder, which has Performance Environment.unity. Once 
this scene is active, all you should have to do is press the play button and the environment will show in the Oculus headset. 

## Equipment and Resources
