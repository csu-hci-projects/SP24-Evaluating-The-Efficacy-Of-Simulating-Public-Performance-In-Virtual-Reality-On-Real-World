## Responsibilities

For the first half of the experiment, the team had been divided into different responsibilities. Nicolo would primarily code, Jake would primarily write, and Erik would split effort between coding and writing. 

After seeing that there was less coding than anticipated, both Erik and Nicolo placed more effort on writing the paper. Nicolo was responsible for all of the VR arrangements, taking care of the headset, setting up the environment and manipulating assets to create the environment for the experiment.

Each member contributed their sources for the paper and related works section.

## Experiment Design and Execution
All three members of the team were equally involved and responsible for the experiment design, experiment execution, and data analysis. 

## Thoughts
The team worked well together, no one felt unsupported at any point in the experiment and all members were communicative and present.
